## Projects
### License Plate Detector
[Github](https://github.com/alecwslim/LicensePlateDetector-)

- Created a program using a Yolov10 object detection model to detect license plates and preprocess an image of the license plate to be used by an OCR model to retrieve the plate number.

### Analysis of Industrial Land, Poverty, and Environmental Illness in San Diego County
[Github](https://github.com/alecwslim/SD-Poverty-Analysis)

- Conducted a group data science project to investigate the relationship between proximity to military and industrial land, poverty, and the rates of environmental illness in cities within San Diego County
- Determined a strong positive correlation between higher poverty rates and increased instances of environmental illnesses, underscoring the significant impact of socioeconomic status on health outcomes.

### Understanding the Intersectionality of Crime in Los Angeles
[Github](https://github.com/alecwslim/Crime-in-Los-Angeles)

- This study explored the intersection of demographic, spatial, and temporal factors in understanding crime patterns in Los Angeles.
- Our findings revealed significant disparities in victim demographics, specifically ethnicity, highlighting systemic inequities that disproportionately affect minority and vulnerable populations.

### Analysis of Supervised Machine Learning Models
[Github](https://github.com/alecwslim/supervised-ML-algo-analysis)

- Investigated the performance differences between three machine learning models, which were implemented using Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, KNN, SVM) for the binary classification use case.
- Concluded that the random forest model has the best accuracy compared to SVM and KNN.
